# This repository contains our Project #2 files
Team-critique: It was pretty fun to work together. Each person has each part they are strong with so I think that it was easy to solve troubles than usual. At first we choose what page they want to charge with. After that, we share ideas and care whole pages.

Self-critique: At start, I am in charge of master of project and work for login page. Looking other member's requesting codes is very useful for studying codes and designing page is so interesting. I also make images for project.  Making new design follows original one or new thing is pretty new for me.
